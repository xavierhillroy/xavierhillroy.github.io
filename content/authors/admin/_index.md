I'm an MSc student at McMaster University working in the Creative Algorithms Lab under Dr. Stephen Kelly. My research focuses on Linear Genetic Programming for interpretable visual reinforcement learning, with interests in GPU/FPGA acceleration and interpretable AI systems.
Previously, I completed my undergraduate degree at Western University, where I worked on genetic algorithm optimization for JPEG XL compression with Dr. Mahmoud El-Sakka. This research was published in Electronics (MDPI).
In my free time, I enjoy reading and meditation.
